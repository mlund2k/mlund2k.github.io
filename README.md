# Matt Lund - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About Me
Hey there, I'm Matt. I currently hold a B.S. in Applied Physics with a computational specialization. Throughout my academics, I have built a strong quantitative, analytical, problem-solving skillset that has led me to pursue a career in the field of data science. Working with historical data to uncover data-driven insights and predict outcomes excites me as it can be powerful when applied to just about any problem in everyday life.

In my free time outside of academics, I have worked to expand my skillset and experience all that data science has to offer. I have also gained internship experience cleaning, validating, and analyzing different formats of data, as well as academic experience constructing data structures, coding, and visualizing data, which I believe will serve as the foundations of my career in data analytics.

Feel free to visit my [resume](https://github.com/mlund2k/mlund2k.github.io/blob/main/ML%20resume%209_12.pdf) for an overview of my skills and experience:

I plan to populate this page with personal projects that may interest those looking to work with me or assess my skills, as well as for me to monitor my own progress.
